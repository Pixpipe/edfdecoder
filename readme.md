This project is a EDF file decoder in Javascript, for browser and NodeJS. Due to the lack of standard format in the world of electroencephalogram (EEG), EDF progressively took that seat, even though it is limited and far from perfect. Thanks to its simple specification, the EDF format is also used in many other bio-medical fields, not only EEG.  

It is important to mention that two format are labeled EDF:
- The regular EDF format ([link](https://www.edfplus.info/specs/edf.html))
- The extended EDF+ ([link](https://www.edfplus.info/specs/edfplus.html))

**This parser is NOT compatible with EDF+.**
